Penetration Testing Tool - Project 1
Overview
This project aims to build a penetration testing tool targeting common web application vulnerabilities. The tool focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a controlled environment, specifically targeting Broken Access Control, Command Injection, and Vulnerable and Outdated Components.

Tools and Platforms
bWAPP: Vulnerable web application used for testing.
Web Security Academy: Used for additional exploitation techniques.
Burp Suite: Primary tool used for penetration testing.
Project Activities
Identification of Vulnerable Software

Selected bWAPP as the target software for testing due to its variety of built-in vulnerabilities.
Scoping Exercise

Conducted a thorough scoping exercise to understand the software's architecture, connections, and scope.
Output: Scoping Assessment Document (Included in the repo).
Penetration Testing Plan

Developed a comprehensive penetration testing plan that aligns with the OWASP framework and common TTPs.
Output: Penetration Testing Plan (Included in the repo).
Penetration Testing Execution

Identified and utilized open-source tools (e.g., Burp Suite) to execute penetration tests.
Conducted meetings with tool owners to ensure factual accuracy of findings.
Output: Draft Penetration Testing Report (Included in the repo).
Risk Assessment and Remediation

Risk assessed the findings based on a risk management framework and proposed remediation steps.
Output: Final Penetration Testing Report (Included in the repo).
GitHub Workflow
Branching: Created separate branches for each vulnerability and their respective test scenarios.
Commits: Regularly committed changes, test cases, and scripts to the relevant branches.
Scripts: All custom scripts for exploiting identified vulnerabilities are included in the scripts/ directory.
