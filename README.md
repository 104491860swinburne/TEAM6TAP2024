Build a Penetration Testing Tool
Project Overview
This project involves building a tool to perform penetration tests on a suitable software (in a contained and safe environment) that holds sensitive information. The project aims to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and propose remediation strategies.
1. Identification of Vulnerable Software
- Chose bWAPP and DVWA as vulnerable software. 
- These both software contain training exercise to learn the importance of cyber security ethically
2. Penetration Testing Plan Development
- List planned test scenarios
- Define expected outcomes for pass/fail criteria
- Outline planned testing methodologies
- Deliverables:
- Penetration testing tool
3.Project Requirements
- Contained testing environment
- Access to suitable software with sensitive information
- Knowledge of OWASP framework and common penetration testing methodologies
- Familiarity with open-source penetration testing tools
- Understanding of risk management frameworks 
4. Open Source Penetration Tools Identification
- Researched and chose burpsuite penetration testing tool suitable for testing the vulnerable softwrae open-source tools 
- Presentation and demonstration of selected tools
- Conduct a meeting with the team that is building this tool with me and also with the stakeholder.
5. Risk Assessment and Remediation
- Propose remediation and mitigation strategies
6. Final Deliverable
- A tool capable of partially or fully performing penetration testing on web software for common vulnerabilities.
7. Getting Started
- To set up this project I first had to try out lots of VMs that were compatible and suitable for my softwares and tetsing tool and also had to make sure that they don't affect my local machine. And then had to install and unintsall and check for the right version of the software. A lot goes into the development of the project.
- Had to make a github repo and make commits and edits to that so that one of my data is lost and is stored. 
- Working on developing a script that detects the vulnerability in a software and also to be able to detect the line of code that has the vulnerable code in it.
